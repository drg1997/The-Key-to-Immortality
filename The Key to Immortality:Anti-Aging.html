        <div class="col-md-9"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society has long been focused on retaining youth.  Whether it be through cosmetics that claim to make you look younger, or through healthy diet and exercise, everyone seems to be fighting against time.  There hasn't really been a consensus on what aging is.  It is most accurately defined as an accumulation of errors in your cells, causing accumulation of dead cells as debris, slowing of cellular function and eventually death.   The key to retaining youth is to strengthen natural cell repair mechanisms which can clean away the dead cells and keep the body running smoothly.  This can be done by enzymes or gene therapy, but the most promising idea is that of nanobots. </p></div>

        <h2>NanoBots</h2>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanobots, with regards to anti-aging, are microscopic robots that patrol the bloodstream, killing viruses and
          pathogens it encounters, as well as cleaning away junk.  The goal is to have them be able to manipulate individual
          atoms, which is a technology far off in the horizon.  The idea comes from the immune cells which do this naturally
          in our immune system.</p>

	      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was actually a huge debate on the subject that aired in 2001.  Nobel Laureate Richard Smalley was skeptical
          of the idea.  He said that there are forces, on the atomic scale, that would prevent these nanobots from working.
          Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology brought to his attention that the body already has these types
          of machines built in naturally (i.e. ribosomes, the immune system).  He says it's only a matter of applying the
          techniques of ribosomes and the immune system to machinery.</p>

          <div class="col-md-10"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, there have been many scientific breakthroughs that shift the opinion to Drexlers side.  Phones are
          getting smaller and smaller.  Ray Kurzweil, a prominent inventor and futurist is convinced that someday, nanobots
          will shape society.  With this of course there are fears.  Ethicists argue that this ability is far too powerful
          and that humans wouldn't know how to use it wisely.  There is always the possibility that these nanobots become
          collectively sentient, working together to reproduce and take over our bodies like a virus.  The Jellyfish man
          himself said it best when he said "We're very strange animals, we're so clever and civilized, but our hearts are
          very primitive."</p></div></div>

        <h2>Telomeres</h2>

        <div class="container"><div class="col-md-2"><img src="http://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm-news/images/2015/01/telomeres.jpg" height="125" width="170"/></div>
        <div class="col-md-10"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another example of our primitive hearts is the idea of telomere length.
          On 2013 Stanford Medicine published an article about telomeres, which are repeat sequences of DNA at the end of
          our chromosomes.  They are believed to protect the fragile inner DNA from deteriorating.  Each time a cell divides,
          the chromosomes lose a certain amount of base pairs, which make the proteins we need to survive.</p></div></div>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As each cell
        division progresses, errors accumulate and we don't make the proteins we need.  Cells die and we begin the slow,
        painful aging process.  Your DNA's first line of defense is the telomere which sacrifices itself to protect your
        precious DNA.  At one point someone thought, "if our telomeres are longer, than we will live longer!"  And they
        are right, kind of.  Cells treated with telomerase, a telomere building enzyme, do behave as if
        they are younger.  They multiply rapidly.  One benefit to this is that it helps drug developers quickly get a
        large amount of cells from slow growing human cells.  What is preferable about this technique has to do with the
        transient effect of temporary exponential growth.  It's like speeding up into a traffic jam.  You may get farther
        than the other cars, but you will still end up stuck, which in this case is a good thing.  Uncontrolled exponential
        growth can cause tumors and may lead to cancer.  The controversy of the field is whether or not the transient effect
        applies to telomerase activity.  No one really knows for sure.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen Blau from Stanford Medicine claims that "This new approach paves the
          way toward preventing or treating diseases of aging."  Telomerase extension can in fact help treat diseases like
          Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Progeria where the body ages prematurely.  Most of the supporters of telomerase
          extension claim that there is substantial evidence that a person's life span is determined by how many times their
          cells can divide before the accumulation of errors shuts down the body.  One product TA-G5 has been released that
          is a "transient inducer of telomerase activity."  Is it really transient?</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One scientist at the helm of the anti-telomerase side gives a grim metaphor.
          He describes cancer as a runaway car.  Oncogenes act as a brick on the gas pedal.  The loss of tumor suppressor
          genes act as a brake failure.  This is why cancer is so deadly.  Cancer cells have telomeres too however and they
          divide very rapidly, meaning that they have limited lifetimes.  They don't have unlimited gas.  Now factor in a
          drug like TA-G5.  With the addition of telomere extension inducers, the cancer cells would never run out of fuel.
          The car would eventually crash and most likely explode.
          But maybe we can make ourselves live longer, by destroying the telomeres of
          cancer cells.  Without telomeres the cancer cells would, in theory, deteriorate far quicker.  We would need to design
          an enzyme to do this as well as a way to assure that the drug would only affect the cancer cells.  It is ironic that
          both the extension and destruction of telomeres could cause longer life.  It seems that they are central to the
          longevity of life.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just because you are biologically immortal, doesn't mean you can escape death.
          You could extend your telomeres all you want, one deadly disease or slightly rude remark to your mother could quickly
          remind you of your mortality.  The only solution for true immortality, has to do with a project called the connectome
          project.</p>
