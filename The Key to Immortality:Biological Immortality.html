      <h3>What is Immortality?</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word immortality is thrown around a lot.  Immortality technically means the inability to die,
        but it can also be used in more loose terms.  For example, the elves in Lord of the Rings are referred to as
        immortal, however they are still able to die in battle.  For now, let's use this interpretation of the word
        immortal, which is also referred to as biological immortality.</p>

      <h3>Biological Immortality</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the ancient works of Gilgamesh, the term immortal has been surrounded by fantasy.  It wasn't until the
        late 1960's that marine biologist Christian Sommer accidentally discovered immortality in the form of
        Turritopsis Dohrnii, which would later come to be known as The Immortal Jellyfish.  He first described it as
        "refusing to die."  A more scientific explanation is that all stages of Turritopsis Dohrnii can revert back into
        their polyp stage, successfully "escaping death".  Theoretically, this can be repeated indefinitely, rendering
        the jellyfish biologically immortal.</p>

      <h3>Transdifferentiation</h3>

      <div class="container"><div class="col-md-2"><img src="http://www.news.wisc.edu/newsphotos/images/Zhang_otx2_tuj1_10.jpg" height="130" width="170"></div>
      <div class="col-md-10"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of transdifferentiation, which is the key to the Jellyfish's immortality, draws a lot of parallels
        with stem cell research.  With regards to Turritopsis Dohrnii, transdifferentiation is the process by which an
        adult somatic cell "undifferentiates" and then "redifferentiates" based on the environmental pressure placed
        on it.  The difference between transdifferentiation and induced pluripotency is that transdifferentiation
        never has to reach the pluripotent stage, it has to only go so far as the progenitor cell stage, to be able
        to redifferentiate into what type of cell it is destined to be.</p></div></div>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give a metaphor, imagine you left your phone
        charger at home. Induced pluripotency drives you back to your house, as opposed to transdifferentiation which
        takes you to the nearest gas station and buys you a new one.</p>

      <h3>Is T.Dohrnii Really Immortal?</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Carlton, professor of Marine Science at William says no.  His argument is that the word immortality
        is being used willy nilly.  In his words, "the word immortal is distracting, if immortal means passing on
        your genes, then yes, it's immortal."  He is willing to accept that the cells are immortal, but not that the
        whole organism is.</p>

	    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RR Helm, writer for Deep Sea News, argues that nothing is immortal.  He says that while it is a cool trick,
        no organism can survive the eventual doom of the aging process.</p>

        <div class="col-md-10"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the most fervent believer in jellyfish immortality though, is Shin Kubota, who is the only person
        in the world to successfully sustain a colony of T. dohrnii.  The colony he has observed for two years has
        gone through a reported 11 rebirths.  Not only is he a prominent marine biologist, but also a self-proclaimed
        pop star who has recorded several songs about his jellyfish.  However, not all believers in jellyfish immortality are greeting it with open arms.</p></div>
      </div>

	    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Maria Miglietta
        warns society against the eventual takeover of the jellyfish.  She writes "Since the species is immortal,
        the number of individuals is rising fast.  We are looking at a worldwide silent invasion."  While this may
        seem kind of ridiculous, the leading expert in the field Shin himself agrees.  He frequently talks of the
        frailty of humans and all of their weaknesses.  Once when suffering a bacterial infection he dauntingly said
        "Human Beings very weak.  Bacteria very strong.  I want to be immortal!"  According to one reporter, the
        look on his face was one of "deep fear masked in forced humor."  He is also quoted as saying "Nature is so
        beautiful, how peaceful would it be if humans disappeared."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the most daunting thing he has ever said, resonates with his country's history.  He said
        "I'm worried that we will apply the science too early, like we did with the atomic bomb."  Even the
        most fervent believers in immortality know it's shortcomings, and whether or not the immortality of
        T. Dohrnii poses a threat to society, the idea itself holds a lot of ethical uncertainty.  While
        jellyfish live out their normal lives being gifted by nature with immortality, some organisms
        desperately search for it. </p>
