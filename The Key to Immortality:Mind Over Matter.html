          I must warn you, I am in no way a \technology expert and just recently I called apple because my computer ran out of
          battery and I didn't know what to do.</p><p>The Connectome Project is in my opinion one of the most ambitious
          undertakings in the last decade.  Dr. Sebastian Seung, the brains behind the project, plans to map the human brain
          neuron for neuron, with the goal being the ability to get your connectome sequenced.  Every thought you have, every
          idea you come up with, would theoretically be represented in your connectome.  But would you want your connectome
          sequenced?  Maybe not.</p></div>

        <h2>The Caveman Principle</h2>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, a TV program aired on BBC called Total Isolation.  In this show,
          six people were locked in a nuclear bunker for days on end with little to no possibility of them using their
          senses.  They could think all they wanted but the eventual absence of sensory information gave them interesting
          out-of-body experiences.  Many said that they felt as if they could walk out of their body and look at it.
          They experienced severe hallucinations, trauma and eventually when they emerged, all 6 were shown to have serious
          mental deterioration.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Author Michio Kaku says that humans will never download their consciousness
          into computers because we are cavemen at heart, requiring a lot of sensory information to keep us happy.
          (By the way, Michio Kaku's book The Future of the Mind is possibly the most intriguing book I have ever read.
          I would highly recommend it if you are interested in the inner workings of the mind.)  Imagine life without being
          able to smell your favorite smells, or taste your favorite tastes.  Everything would be reduced to a chemical
          reaction and numbers.  People generally prefer to remain ignorant enough to retain a sense that they are special
          and that their surroundings are not just a combination of physics and chemistry but of emotions and feelings, and
          that's not a bad thing.</p>

        <h2>Ughhh, My conciousness is taking forever to download</h2>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution then would be to place your connectome inside a robotic surrogate
          body.  You could then freely wander around and touch or taste anything you wanted, without having to worry about
          your eventual demise.  If your robot body got destroyed, revival would simply be a matter of downloading into a
          different robot body.   As ridiculous as this all may sound, it's all perfectly plausible.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main criticism of this theory is that the robot brain would be way too
          big for the robot head.  With today's technology, it would take a city sized computer to do what it takes your
          3 pound brain can do.  The computational hypothesis of brain function however states that an exact replica of your
          brain will experience your consciousness, regardless of what it's made of.  Which leads to David Eagleman's theory. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He disagrees with Michio Kaku.  He argues that people will settle for the
          computer generated feelings and emotions as they can be perfectly tailored to fit the desires of the people.
          He predicts that one day, we will all download our consciousness onto a massive network and live in a virtual
          world where we can buy new feelings, or share our consciousness with our followers.  His prediction draws close
          parallels to Arthur C. Clarke's story, the City and The Stars, which described a world in which people were
          information.</p>

        <p>And who knows?  Maybe one day scientists will isolate the genes that make T. Dohrnii immortal and figure out a way to give humans the gift of reverse aging, making Benjamin Button another prediction that fiction has made right.  Or maybe the use of specially designed telomere killing enzymes will cure cancer forever.  Maybe quantum consciousness will someday transcend life and the universe will be controlled by immortal balls of energy floating around destroying planets they've had petty squabbles with.  Crazier theories have been proposed. </p>
